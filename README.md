# Code test - Mortage plan

Client-server type solution with SQLite database.

### Backend
REST API styled app made with Java Spark web framework  
Install dependencies in pom.xml with maven and run  
The app should run on port 4567  

### Frontend
React application  
Install dependecies in package.json with npm  
Run with command "npm start"  
The app should run on port 3000  
(If your backend runs on some other port than 4567 you need to change the port value in baseUrl variable in "frontend/src/service.js" in order to get the frontend to connect to the backend)

Use the app with browser [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
